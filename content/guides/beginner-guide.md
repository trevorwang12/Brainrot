### The Basic Gameplay Loop

2. **Generate Cash**: Brainrots in your base automatically produce currency
3. **Expand Your Collection**: Use cash to purchase new brainrots or steal from other players
4. **Upgrade and Progress**: Invest in base improvements and work toward rebirth milestones

## Essential Game Controls

### Navigation and Movement
- **WASD Keys**: Move your character around the map
- **Mouse**: Look around and control camera angle  
- **Shift**: Run faster (uses energy)
- **Space**: Jump over obstacles

### Core Interactions

- **E Key**: Alternative interaction key for certain objects
- **Tab**: Access inventory and collection management
- **M**: Open the full map view

## Understanding Brainrots

### What Are Brainrots?

Brainrots are the central collectible items in the game. They generate cash over time and serve as the foundation of your economic strategy.

### Rarity System Basics

Brainrots come in seven rarity tiers:
- **Common (Gray)**: Most frequent, low value
- **Uncommon (Green)**: Regular drops, moderate value
- **Rare (Blue)**: Less common, good value
- **Epic (Purple)**: Uncommon drops, high value
- **Legendary (Gold)**: Rare drops, very high value
- **Mythic (Red)**: Very rare drops, extremely high value
- **Secret (Rainbow)**: Ultra-rare drops, maximum value

### Mutations and Special Features

Some brainrots have special mutations that multiply their value:
- **Gold Mutation**: 2x cash multiplier
- **Diamond Mutation**: 3x cash multiplier
- **Rainbow Mutation**: 5x cash multiplier

## Base Management Fundamentals

### Choosing Your Base Location

Each of the eight base locations offers unique advantages:
- Consider proximity to shops and other players
- Evaluate defensive positioning for theft protection
- Plan for future expansion and base development

### Basic Base Development

**Early Priorities**:
1. Secure cash-generating brainrots
2. Establish basic defensive measures
3. Create organized storage areas
4. Plan expansion routes

**Layout Principles**:
- Keep valuable brainrots in secure, hard-to-reach locations
- Create clear pathways for easy navigation
- Balance accessibility with security

## Economic Strategy for Beginners

### Cash Generation Optimization

**Focus on Quantity First**: In early gameplay, having many brainrots matters more than rarity
**Reinvestment Strategy**: Use generated cash to buy more brainrots before pursuing luxury items
**Patience Pays**: Allow brainrots to generate cash rather than selling immediately

### Smart Shopping

**Shop Priorities**:
1. Additional brainrots for cash generation
2. Basic base upgrades for security and efficiency
3. Tools and items that enhance gameplay

**Budget Management**:
- Keep emergency cash reserves
- Don't spend everything on single expensive items
- Balance current needs with future investments

## The Stealing Mechanic

### Understanding Theft

Stealing is a core game mechanic where players can take brainrots from other bases, but it comes with risks and consequences.

**How Stealing Works**:

- Deal with the alert system that notifies the owner

### Theft Protection Strategies

**For Your Base**:

**When Stealing (Advanced)**:
- Study target bases before attempting theft
- Plan escape routes in advance
- Consider the value versus risk ratio
- Be prepared for retaliation
